        <!--Yeah, it's a little cringy but I needed to talk about something to move forward with the program-->
        <p>I got into HTML at first because of my Information Processing class. I was entered into the Khan Academy program with little expectations of what coding in HTML would be like. I soon found out how very addictive coding really is. </p>

        <p> I've learned so much about coding over the course of this week. Prior to all of this, I only knew a bit of Java, but now I'm on my way to being fluent in HTML <em>and</em> CSS!<br></p>
        <p> Once I saw the layout of HTML and CSS, I saw the possibilites of what could be done and got extremely motivated to continue in my journey. I may continue to update this blog, who knows, probably no one will see it but I'd still like to try.
